# Ember.js Dashboard

This is the repo for [Ember.js Dashboard](http://pangratz.github.com/ember.js-dashboard), which shows the activity of the community unified at one glance. It aggregates the latest stuff from [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/emberjs), events in the ember.js [GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) repository, latest questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emberjs) and stuff from [reddit/emberjs](http://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/).

I wrote this dashboard because I constantly hit those 4 pages in intervals of 1 minute, just to see if there's something new. With this dashboard I can check out all this 4 times more in the minute :pensive:

## Hack

The project is organized with the layout from the excellent [interline/ember-skeleton](https://github.com/interline/ember-skeleton).

To hack around clone this very repo and do a `bundle install` and afterwards a simple `bundle exec rackup` to start your local server. Then go to `http://localhost:9292`, hack around and hit refresh to see the changes.

Pull Requests are **very** welcome! Questions? Find me on Twitter @pangratz.

Holy Moly.
